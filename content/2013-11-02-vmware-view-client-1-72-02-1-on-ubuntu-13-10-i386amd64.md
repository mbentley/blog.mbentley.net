In a [previous post][1], I wrote about how to configure vmware-view-client 1.7 and 2.0 on Ubuntu 13.04. I went ahead and verified that vmware-view-client works just fine on Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10 using the same steps as described [in the original post][1]. I've updated the steps there to also include version 2.1 which is now available. There is not anything different that has to be done to install 2.1 vs 2.0 but I figured I would mention that since it is available and does seem to work just fine.

As usual, let me know if you have any issues and I will see what I can figure out.
