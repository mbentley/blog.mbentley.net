it looks like vmware-view-client has a new version available (version 1.6.0). i went forward with creating these but i haven't had any time to test a whole lot (i've only tested with debian squeeze) so if anyone wants to try them out and report back to me, that would be greatly appreciated.

## vmware-view-client 1.6.0 - debian squeeze, ubuntu 10.04 and mint 9
[i386][1] | [amd64][2]

## vmware-view-client 1.6.0 - debian sid, ubuntu 12.10 and mint 14
[i386][3] | [amd64][4]

## vmware-view-client 1.6.0 - ubuntu 12.04
[i386][5] | [amd64][6]

as always, i will try to answer any comments as soon as i can.
