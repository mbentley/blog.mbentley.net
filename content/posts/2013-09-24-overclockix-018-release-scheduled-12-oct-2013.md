It has been a while since I have released an updated version of [Overclockix][1]. I was considering releasing a new version in the near future but since Debian has scheduled [the next point release (7.2) for October 12th][2], I might as well go ahead and wait until then to release a new version. There are a few bug fixes and tweaks that are going into this next version that I think will be great to have in place. ~~So in order to give me a few days to get a new release ready,~~ I just remembered that I won't be around on the 14th so I'm planning on releasing version .018 on Saturday, October 12th.
