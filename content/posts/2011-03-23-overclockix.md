i probably won't be posting on here for some time as i am planning on dedicating my time working on [overclockix][1] in my free time. in case you do not know what overclockix is, it is a customized linux live distro (based on debian) which i am helping to revive. if you would like to contribute to the project in any way, let me know in the [project thread @ overclockers.com][2].
