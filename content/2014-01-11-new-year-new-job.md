I recently left my previous job for an opportunity to work at [Arcus][1] with some awesome people on some cutting edge technologies. It should be a good change for me and I hope that it inspires some more blogging. I'll be working with some new (or at least new to me) open source tools and as I learn, I hope that I can share some info with anyone who may stumble upon this place. One of the things that I hope to blog about will be [Docker][2]. I certainly have some work cut out for me in terms of getting up to speed quickly but it's something that really looks to have some great promise.
